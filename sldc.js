// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step. This is also part of the planning process and helps identify what the application should do."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the application is modeled and shows how the application works."
const implementation = "This is the forth step in which the actual software is written."
const testingAndIntegration = "This fifth setp is to identify what works and does not work with the application so it is fit for use with minimal issues, and once it is ready it is deployed or integrated."
const maintain = "This is the final step, but it is a recurring action that takes place to ensure that the applications function stays up to date in the ever changing aether that is the world of code."
